## Hydra
#### Nematocyst Discharge

Stinging cells (nematocytes) in jellyfish, sea anemone, and hydra (all from the phylum Cnidaria) discharge their contents at extremely fast rates.  For example, [this video of many nematocysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJiBc_N1Zk) discharging simultaneously or [this video of a single nematocyst](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/science/nematocyst-discharge/) discharge show what the process looks like.

High speed imaging of Hydra from 
[Nüchter et al. Curr Biol 2006](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CFU_P5xovp63FzKKlri6c5yTNwNzjeBO) show this discarge can occur in 700 nanoseconds, and the stylet (barbs) accelerate at 5 million g's of acceleration:

(B) Sequence of high speed images showing this process experimentally. The nematocst is roughly 10 um in diameter, and the time between each image is 500 ns.

| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 700 ns |
| Max. Velocity | 37 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 5.3 X $$10^7$$ m/s$$^2$$ | 



Wikipedia has a good description of nematocytes in the section on [Cnidocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Cnidocytes). The possible mechanisms  for the rapid release of energy in this system are outlined in that section as well:

> + Rapid contraction of elastic collagen-like fibers in the walls of the capsule
> + The thread acts like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released
> + Chemical changes in the capsule contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization.
> + Chemical changes in the liquid in the capsule make it a much more concentrated solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.

 For further rearding, [Koch et al. J Cell Sci 1998](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FDeOC1uCXSm3mZ_uhf2bb_3b2A58FMAT) has more details about the structure of the components of a nemacoyst. 

## Fungi
### Ballistospore ejection
There are 30,000 species of mushroom, yeasts and pathogenic rusts/smuts make use of a surface tension catapult to spread its spores to reproduce (hence the name ballistospore combination of ballistic and spore).

The Paper ([Pringle et al. Mycologia 2005](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l61XLYrZkQ6vT2PlwgRzD-ZIDDHwxxYm)) shows that the ejection of the spore occurs when the Buller’s drop (a droplet of water that forms at the base of the spore near the sterigma) combines with a film of water on the spore itself, and releases the energy stored in its surface tension. Figure 1 shows the images taken at high speed of the process taking place. Figure 2 depicts the mechanism that drives the process.

![Figure 1](images/ballistospore-surface-tension-catapult.png)
**Figure 1:** 
***A.*** *Spore sits on top of the sterigma (a part of the fungus). Displays the growth of the Buller's drop and final frame is after the spore and the drop have disappeared (10 s between each frame).* 
***B.*** *Images of Buller’s Drop and ballistospore using a high-speed camera (10 μs between each frame).*

![Figure 2](images/ballistospore-launch-mechanism.png)
#### Figure 2:  Illustrates the surface tension catapult. 
***A.*** *Buller’s drop forms at the base of the spore, energy is stored here in the form of surface tension.* 
***B.*** *Buller’s drop touches the side of the spore and merges with the fluid, releasing the tension, causing an upward movement, and a downward force on the sterigma and a bit of rotation.* 
***C.*** *Once the Buller’s drop reaches the tip of the spore it stops abruptly due to surface tension preventing it from leaving the spore. This causes the spore to be shot upward along with the droplet.*

## Bunchberry dogwood
Bunchberry dogwood (*Cornus canadensis*) is a plant that grows in dense carpets in the spruce-fir forests of the North American taiga [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK). Bunchberry grows clusters of up to ten berries, from which the plant gets its name [[2]](https://www.thespruce.com/bunchberry-shade-ground-cover-2132948). Bunchberry flowers grow in groups (inflorescences) surrounded by four white bracts, as seen in Figure 1a. In Figure 1b, we can see that an individual flower has four petals (which droop down in the second image) and four stamens, each composed of a long filament and an anther on top which stores the pollen.

![Bunchberry flowers](images/bunchberry-flowers.png)
<br>
__Figure 1:__ *(a) An inflorescence of 30 bunchberry flowers. (b) Close-up of a single mature flower before and after opening. Elastic energy is stored in the bent filaments, which protrude from between the petals in a closed bud. Scale bar = 1 mm. (c) Pollen distribution from one flower triggered in a closed room showing that even minor air currents can carry pollen. White star shows location of flower; each yellow dot represents a pollen grain or clump of grains. Scale bar = 5 cm.* [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aDwN8sZAc_1h2zxtPX4dvLuHWyw_RZUB)

In a young flower bud, the filaments are short and the petals are fused along the edges, completely enclosing the stamens [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aDwN8sZAc_1h2zxtPX4dvLuHWyw_RZUB). As a flower matures, the stamens lengthen faster than the petals and become bent, as seen in the first image in Figure 1b. Elastic energy is stored in the bent stamens in the form of turgor pressure—pressure that arises from the plant cells being full of water, which tends to straighten out the stamens [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aDwN8sZAc_1h2zxtPX4dvLuHWyw_RZUB).

One of the four petals typically has a larger part that acts as a trigger, which can be seen in Figure 1b [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aDwN8sZAc_1h2zxtPX4dvLuHWyw_RZUB). The flower will also eventually burst open on its own. When the flower opens, the plant tissue holding the petals together is torn and the elastic energy stored in the stamens is released, catapulting the pollen up into the air. The force required to trigger the opening (0.1–0.5 mN) favors large pollinators, such as bumblebees, that move quickly between inflorescences and excludes smaller and slower visitors such as ants [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK). Flowers that open on their own can also spread pollen via the wind, as shown in Figure 1c [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK).

Here is a video of the pollen being released: [https://youtu.be/kDbHMDIYKzw](https://youtu.be/kDbHMDIYKzw).

![Bunchberry flower opening](images/bunchberry-flower-opening.png)
<br>
__Figure 2__: *Bunchberry flower opening, recorded on video at 10,000 frames per second. Time elapsed is indicated. First frame shows a closed flower with four petals fused at the tip, restraining the stamens. Blur represents the distance moved in 0.1 ms. Scale bar, 1mm.* [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK)

In this process, the stamens reach velocities of 3.1 ± 0.5 m/s and accelerations of 24,000 ± 6,000 m/s$$^2$$ (2,400 *g*), while the petals reach velocities of 6.7 ± 0.5 m/s and accelerations of 22,000 ± 6,000 m/s$$^2$$ (2,200 *g*) [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK). The pollen granules reach a height of 2.5 cm (more than 10 times the height of the flower) and can then be dispersed by the wind.

In bunchberry flowers, the stamen functions similarly to a miniature medieval trebuchet, a special catapult that maximizes throwing distance by having the payload (in this case, the pollen in the anther) attached to the throwing arm (the filament) by a hinge or a flexible strap [[1]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mhsZLLmR3mQ6wnW22S2vXWh6pQbb_hfK). In fact, Whitaker et al. have shown that in bunchberry flowers, anther rotation about the filament tips delays the release of pollen until the vertical speed is maximized [[3]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aDwN8sZAc_1h2zxtPX4dvLuHWyw_RZUB).

## Trap-jaw ant
#### Mandible strike

The mandible strike of trap-jaw ants serve as methods to avoid or eject predators and capture prey. During a mandible strike, trap-jaw ants close their mandibles at incredible speeds over short durations in specific orientations and strike surfaces to fit their desired function (avoiding predators,... ). Their common propulsion behaviors are named "bouncer defense" and "escape jump." Bouncer defense is when trap-jaw ants strike at predators while propelling themselves away. Escape jumps, on the other hand, is when trap-jaw ants strike at a substrate and vertically propel themselves to escape predation.

## Plant louse

#### Jump

Louse is singular for lice! This summary is about jumping plant lice (psyllidae), which [are a family of small plant-feeding insects that tend to be very host-specific.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyllidae)

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qpi9V0PFsI&t=40s) is a video of one such species walking around. Unfortunately, catching its jump with a normal camera is probably close to impossible, given how fast they jump. However, in [this paper,](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13JHzVvbg-OZJOg0LRv6u5-BCOK8px6Ir) researchers have used high-speed cameras to capture the following images of a specific species of plant lice" 

##### Images of a jump by Psylla alni, viewed from the side and capturedat 5000 Hz, each with an exposure time of 0.05 ms. The images are arranged in two columns, with the bottom left-hand corner of each image providing a constant reference point in this and in Figs 5, 7–9. The hind legs started to move at –2.4 ms, and the continuing depression of the hind trochantera raised the rear of the body so that the middle legs lost contact with the ground and the head pitched forwards. Once airborne, the body rotated rapidly in the pitch plane. The cartoons show how the angle of the body relative to the ground was measured when the head was pointing upwards (frame –2.4 ms) and then downwards (frame 0 ms).
![Plant Lice Jump from Burrows Fig. 4](Plant_Lice_1.png)


##### Summary of Kinematic Peformance from Burrows

| Kinematic Metric | Lice performance |
| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 0.9 - 1.7 ms |
| Max. Velocity | 1.1 - 2.7 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | ~2 X $$10^3$$ m/s$$^2$$ | 



The mechanism for the rapid release of energy is known in detail. Generally, these lice jump similarly to other insects, with the exception that they have a distinct take-off position in which the head points downwards and the front supports the bug, similar to a person doing a hand-stand. 

For further rearding, [Burrows JEB 2012](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13JHzVvbg-OZJOg0LRv6u5-BCOK8px6Ir) has more details about the physics of plant lice jumps and the relevant anatomy. 



## Aquatic bladderworts
#### Suction trap

Aquatic bladderworts are carnivorous plants plants that use suction traps to catch small prey. Suction is created by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which releases stored elastic energy. This trapping mechanism is one of the fastest known plant movements.

The suction trapping mechanism has two stages: a slow phase, and an ultra-fast phase. In the slow phase, the internal glands slowly pump water out of the trap. This reudces the hydrostatic pressure, which increases the elastic energy stored in the walls of the trap. Once the prey stimulates the trigger hairs on the watertight trap door, the ultra-fast phase is initiated. The door opens, causing a rush of water to flow into the trap, pulling in the prey. Then the prey is slowly broken down by a cocktail of digestive enzymes.

##### Images of the slow and ultra-fast phases of the suction trap:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Suction Trap Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort.png)

High speed cameras were used to image this process. The fast opening and closing of the door, with an abrupt change in shape, strongly suggests that the under-lying principle is a buckling of an elastic valve, which is triggered by the trigger hairs on the trap door. 

##### Schematic of trap door deformation:
![Aquatic Bladderwort Buckling Mechanism from Vincent et al.](images/bladderwort2.png)

Simulations of the mechanism show that the the stiffness of the walls of the trap must be optimized to be soft enough to deform sufficiently, but also stiff enough to overcome viscous disspation and move fast enough to catch the prey. 

The suction mechanism of these carnivorous plants is fascinating, and also useful. Since these traps are autonomously repetitive, this research the potential to inform the design of microfluidic devices that must act repeatedly.

| Kinematic Metric | Aquatic Bladderwort performance |

| Duration | < 0.5 ms |
| Max. Fluid Velocity | 1.5 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 600g |

## Froghopper

Froghoppers are a diverse and abundant family of insects known for their incredible jumping capabilities; jumping as high as 115 times its body length. The jumping mechanism for froghoppers are similar to those of locusts and fleas that rely on elongated hind legs to provide propulsion upwards. However, whereas the hind legs of locusts are on the scale of its body length; the hind legs of froghoppers scale to only half of its body length and whose mass contributes only about 2% to its total mass. Therefore, froghoppers must have a unique mechanism that enables them to achieve high jumping heights. This is achieved through a combination of precise body orientation and careful movement of the muscles in the hind legs that provide a large acceleration up to 550g. The froghopper positions himself by raising its hind legs and rapidly depressing its trochantera which sends the insect airborne.

| Duration | 0.875 ms |

## Venus fly trap
#### Snap buckling

[Forterre et al Nature 2005](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18SA4m-iTxUsy19nOkHbWvtjY7VU2YxwH)

The rapid closure of venus fly traps is achieved using a method called snap buckling, where a system "snaps" from one stable state to another stable state. Here's a diagram that visualizes snap buckling.
![Snap Buckling](images/snap-buckling.png)

For reference, here is a labeled diagram of the parts of a venus fly trap.
![Parts of a Venus Fly Trap](images/venus-fly-trap-labeled.jpg)

In the open state, the lobes of the venus fly trap are convex (when viewed from the inside), while in the closed state, the lobes are concave.
![Closed and Open Venus Fly Traps](images/venus-fly-traps.jpg)

When the venus fly trap goes from the open state to the closed state, the lobes undergo snap buckling from convex to concave. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhVKVSkdedY) showing it close up.

The snap closure of venus fly traps usually occur in less than half of a second, though the snap time varies from about 0.2 to 0.8 seconds. Since venus fly traps are also found to grow underwater, researchers timed the closing of submerged venus fly traps, and found that the closing time underwater was not significantly different from the closing time on land.
![Closing Times in Different Mediums](images/venus-fly-traps-closing-times.png)

Additionally, tests involving ink droplets in the water showed that there was no significant outflow of water upon closure, meaning that venus fly traps could effectively catch underwater organisms without failing due to water being forced out, though this has yet to be studied in depth.
![Underwater Test with Ink](images/venus-fly-trap-ink.png)

For further reading, [Poppinga et al Beilstein J Nanotechnol 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902084/) has more information about the snap buckling closing mechanism of venus fly traps.


## Mantis shrimp
Mantis Shrimp, while technically neither a mantis nor a shrimp, are actually another type of crustaceans more technically known as stomatopods. Mantis Shrimp, though only a few inches in length, use Latch Mediated Spring Actuation to fire off deadly punches to protect their territory and hunt prey. Their punches are so strong, they have even been know to break the masks of divers who get too close to their dens. However, these strikes are more commonly used to [break through the shells and exoskeletons of their prey](https://youtu.be/E0Li1k5hGBE?t=129). 

#### Types of Mantis Shrimp
When looking at the anatomy of Mantis Shrimp, we see that the appendages they use to punch can be categorized into two different types: spearers and smashers. The differentiation is in the style of *dactyl*, as shown by [McHenry et al](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y5uxVJzTMgKkaeD1xNOcufjjhUctAL1x):
![Dactyl Differentiation McHenry Fig. 1](images/MSDactyl.png)

## Frog
The Australian Rocket Frog achieves the second longest relative jumping distance for any anuran, 55.2 body lengths for one individual. They also achieve the highest published anuran values for isolated net mean power output, hindlimb length to snout-vent length ratio, and relative hindlimb muscle mass. For the individual that jumped the farthest, it was found that the mean power output expended during takeoff was about 3 times larger than the estimate of available muscle mass output.

## Chameleon
#### Ballistic Tongue Projection
Chameleons project their tongues up to 2 times their body length in order to capture prey. Especially in smaller species, their tongue projection has evolved in order to minimize energy loss and maximize the efficiency of the feeding apparatus. Variation in tongue length, body length, and most notably snout-vent length (distance between cloaca and where the jaw joins, the jaw symphysis), result in the variations in tongue mechanism function. The tongue quick projection and retraction is acheived by 2 muscles, the accerlator muscle and the hyoglossus that are activated sequentially, as the tongue folds in an accordion-like manner. 

##### Figure 2 from Anderson. (A) Peak projection distance, (B) Peak projection velocity, (C) Peak projection acceleration, (D) peak mass/specific power output with respect to snout-vent length.

##### Figure 1 from Anderson et Al. demonstrating the skeletal and muscular components of the projection and retraction mechanism
![Chameleon tongue schematic from Aderson et al](images/tongueApparatusChameleon.JPG)


##### Summary of Kinematic Peformance from Anderson

The kinematic performance of the chameleon tongue mechanism varies between species, with smaller species demonstrating the shortest durations, and highest accelerations and power outputs. The max. velocity acheived is proportional between species. Data was scaled by SVL, or snout-vent length of the species. 

| Kinematic Metric | Chameleon Tongue Performance |
| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 9.7 - 54.6 ms |
| Max. Velocity | 2.91 - 5.41 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 286 - 2,590 m/s$$^2$$ | 
| Max. Power Output | 1410 - 14040 W/kg |
