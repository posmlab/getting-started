# Organisms with Ultra-Fast Biomechanics

Organisms that store and release elastic energy can achieve remarkably fast movements. This page contains examples of organisms that do this, and more information about each of them. 

To contribute to this page, choose an organism from the list below and add information. Some starting references are provided as Google Drive links in each section. If you find other research papers, be sure to save them to the posmlab Google Drive "Papers" folder and link to them here. The organisms listed are from Table 1 of [Ilton et al Science 2018](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uo5F2MfkcKfCjjJiLNwWVN3OzWN_OLh7), but add other examples here if you come across them.

## Hydra
#### Nematocyst Discharge

Stinging cells (nematocytes) in jellyfish, sea anemone, and hydra (all from the phylum Cnidaria) discharge their contents at extremely fast rates.  For example, [this video of many nematocysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJiBc_N1Zk) discharging simultaneously or [this video of a single nematocyst](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/science/nematocyst-discharge/) discharge show what the process looks like.

High speed imaging of Hydra from 
[Nüchter et al. Curr Biol 2006](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CFU_P5xovp63FzKKlri6c5yTNwNzjeBO) show this discarge can occur in 700 nanoseconds, and the stylet (barbs) accelerate at 5 million g's of acceleration:

##### Part of Figure 1 from Nuchter et al. (A) Schematic of a nematocyst discharge. The stylet (black) is rapidly accelerated towards the prey (silver horizontal line). (B) Sequence of high speed images showing this process experimentally. The nematocst is roughly 10 um in diameter, and the time between each image is 500 ns.

##### Summary of Kinematic Peformance from Nuchter et al

| Kinematic Metric | Hydra performance |
| -------- | ------- |
| Duration | 700 ns |
| Max. Velocity | 37 m/s |
| Max. Acceleration | 5.3 X 10^7 m/s^2 | 



Wikipedia has a good description of nematocytes in the section on [Cnidocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria#Cnidocytes). The possible mechanisms  for the rapid release of energy in this system are outlined in that section as well:

> + Rapid contraction of elastic collagen-like fibers in the walls of the capsule
> + The thread acts like a coiled spring that extends rapidly when released
> + Chemical changes in the capsule contents may cause them to expand rapidly by polymerization.
> + Chemical changes in the liquid in the capsule make it a much more concentrated solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.

 For further rearding, [Koch et al. J Cell Sci 1998](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FDeOC1uCXSm3mZ_uhf2bb_3b2A58FMAT) has more details about the structure of the components of a nemacoyst.
